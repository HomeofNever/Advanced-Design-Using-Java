<p>Consider the following practice problems. For all problems, use Javadoc to document all classes and methods. Make sure to follow coding conventions. For each program, provide a script (command, batch) file that would compile and execute your Java code, as well as compile all Javadoc comments into HTML documentation. Write a short readme.txt file explaining how to use the script files.</p>

<li><p class="first">Create an application which allows user to specify a graph by entering indices of non-zero elements from the adjacency matrix. Represent all graph information as a two dimensional array where each row corresponds to a node (one row from the adjacency matrix) and each element within the row corresponds to a node adjacent to this node. (You may assume the graph is unweighted and directed; at most one edge is allowed between any two given nodes; reflexive edges are allowed.) For this problem, use only standard Java arrays (not collections) and do not store zero elements. After user enters all information about a graph, the program should compute and print the following statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>average in-degree and average out-degree (in-degree of a node is the number of incoming edges; out-degree is the number of outgoing edges)</li>
<li>degree sequence (monotonic nonincreasing sequence of node degrees), assuming an undirected graph obtained from the initial directed graph by treating each edge as undirected and eliminating duplicate edges</li>
<li>degree distribution (each degree value is associated with the fraction of nodes in the graph with this degree), assuming an undirected graph obtained from the initial directed graph by treating each edge as undirected and eliminating duplicate edges</li>

Perform weak and strong scaling experiments. For the strong scaling study, make sure to vary the number of threads from 1 to at least twice the number of processors/cores in your system.
