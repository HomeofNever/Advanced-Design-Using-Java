# Setup

This setup assume mysql and tomcat are configured properly. Please consult README.md for detail version

## Database
 
Import `data/farmer.sql` into database, this sql file will create a database called `farmer` and config accordingly. Please make sure login user has database creation permission and `farmer` database is available.

Import command may be find here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting.html , and here is an import command example, assuming user `root` and password `example`:

```bash
mysql -u root -h localhost --protocol TCP -pexample < data/farmer.sql
```

### Application database connection setting

Application will use TCP protocol to connect to mysql, further setting located in `src/java/com/luox6/FarmerMarket/Config.java`  

Please change the setting accordingly for host, port, user, password and database accordingly.

## Maven

This project is built with Maven, please get your system ready by following the guide here: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

## Compile 

Same for any system

```bash
mvn clean package
```

war file would be generated at `target/FarmerMarket-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`, you may also find path in console output.

### For javadoc

```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

site file would be generated at `target/site`, you may also find path in the console output.

## Tomcat

- find tomcat webapps folder `%CATALINA_HOME%\webapps` and paste the war file generated
- rename the file e.g. market.war
- go to tomcat bin folder and run `startup.sh run` or `%CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup.bat` (windows)
- access webpage via browser, local address should be http://localhost:{port}/{WAR_FILE_NAME}

I have included a pre-compiled war file with database connection by default as a reference.
